This a Code for San Jose project forked from Data LA's fork of http://github.com/tkompare /flushots2013.

Instead of mapping locations, it simply maps locations you can donate food.



Changes:
-removed distinction of free/non-free sites
-replaced "flu" with "food"


To reuse:
"a good place to start is in main.js and altering the properties of the "Default" object at the top of the file."
